# Hi there, I'm [Abdelhalem Mansour] 👋

### 🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist | Python Enthusiast
I am a dedicated learner focused on mastering **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**. Currently, I am building a strong foundation through practical projects and professional certifications.

### 🛠️ What I'm working on:
- 📊 Completing the **Data Analysis with Python** certification from freeCodeCamp.
- 🐍 Building 5 core Data Science projects to demonstrate my analytical skills.
- 📚 Solidifying my foundations in Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
